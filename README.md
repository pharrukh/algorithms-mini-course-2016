# Algorithms Mini Course 2016

## 6 week-long Micro-module on Algorithms
### Jun 2016 â€“ Jul 2016

Project descriptionAs a final part of my work in the university, I delivered a 6 week-long micro-module on algorithms. Some Video is available upon request.

I did my best to help students understand:

-  Why are algorithms critical? I showed this by comparing productivity of Core i5 and Raspberry Pi using Python and Fibonacci Number generation algorithms, with Raspberry beating Core i5 laptop.
-  How RSA works? We implemented it from scratch in C# (!).
-  What are sorting algorithms? We played around with students with Insertion, Quick, Merge and Selection sort algorithms.
